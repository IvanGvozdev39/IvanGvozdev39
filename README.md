#### Android Developer

Basics of programming learned in C/C++ in 2021. Since then most of my free time has been spent learning and practicing. In 2022 I found passion in Android development.

Developed EduScope educational application in Java and XML, then, to learn other combinations, wrote EduScope Admin Panel in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Since September 2023 worked on TrickTrack, an app that uses Yandex MapKit to display skate parks and street spots on a map. All 3 applications used Firebase tools, EduScope used Firebase together with SQLite.The most recent one is PexelsApp - a test Pexels API app that taught me to build proper architecture, work more confidently with client-server interactions.

I have a Google Play dev account with 2 apps listed: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Ivan+Gvozdev&hl=ru&gl=US
